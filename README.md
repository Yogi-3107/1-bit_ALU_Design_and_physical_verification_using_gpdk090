# Repo -> 1-bit ALU Design and physical verification using gpdk090
### 1-bit ALU Design, with Functional Analysis and Physical Verification using Cadence provided GPDK090 in Cadence Virtuoso
---

In this project, a **1-bit ALU** is designed using _bottom-up_ approach, i.e., the basic fundamental components are designed before and then integrated afterwards to work as a one functional unit. Also, this design is functionally analysed via simulation (both **Pre-Layout** and **Post-Layout**) as well as physically verified (via **DRC**, **LVS** and **RCX**).

[Cadence Virtuoso](https://www.cadence.com/en_US/home/tools/custom-ic-analog-rf-design/virtuoso-studio.html) is a system design platform for analog, mixed-signal, and RF designs. It is a commercially used and critically acclaimed EDA tool and not open-source. The Virtuoso version that I use is provided to me through my institute, and is an integration of multiple [Cadence](https://www.cadence.com/en_US/home.html) products such as [Virtuoso Schematic Editor](https://www.cadence.com/en_US/home/tools/custom-ic-analog-rf-design/circuit-design/virtuoso-schematic-editor.html), [Virtuoso ADE Suite](https://www.cadence.com/en_US/home/tools/custom-ic-analog-rf-design/circuit-design/virtuoso-ade-suite.html) and [Virtuoso Layout Suite](https://www.cadence.com/en_US/home/tools/custom-ic-analog-rf-design/layout-design/virtuoso-layout-suite.html).

## 1.2 GPDK090
**90nm Generic Process Design Kit** (GPDK090)  is a complete design kit based on a fictitious 90nm BiCMOS process. It is provided by [Cadence](https://www.cadence.com/en_US/home.html) for the purpose of designing, simulating and verifying the ICs for research and educational programs. Manual for the same can be accessed here - [gpdk090-manual](https://www.princeton.edu/~nverma/cadenceSetup_6.1.7/gpdk090_v4.4/docs/gpdk090_spec.pdf).
